# Green Resource Optimizer 🔋

A Software Engineering project designed to monitor system resource usage and use Machine Learning to predict and optimize power consumption.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- **Phase 1: Data Collection** - Python script to gather CPU, RAM, and Process metrics. (Current)
- **Phase 2: AI Integration** - Training a model to recognize "Idle" vs "High Load" states.
- **Phase 3: Optimization** - Automated system adjustments to save energy.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `psutil`, `csv`, `time`
- **Tools:** Git, VS Code

## 📈 How to Run

1. Install dependencies: `pip install psutil`
2. Run the monitor: `python monitor.py`
3. Data is saved locally to `system_data.csv`
